# Project 2

This project runs on the msp430 using the 'make install' command in the timerLib
directory. To install the blink toy we use 'make all' in the project source folder then
on the blinkbuzz directory 'make load' will allow to load the program the MSP. 
The program quickly blinks the leds once it is ready to run then each button performs different
the first makes the led changes from one to the other
the second generates a sound
the third one another sound 
the fourth a more deep tone 
this for the user to play meodies by clicking to the different buttons like a piano
